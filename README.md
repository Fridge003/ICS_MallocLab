# ICS_MallocLab
Introduction to Computer System Lab 07: Implement the malloc function in C

Several different models of heap manager were implemented:
- naive method (mm-naive.c)
- implicit free list(mm-textbook.c)
- explicit free list(mm-explicit.c)
- segregated list(mm-segregated.c)
- final version(mm.c)

a slide decribing the whole process of implementing is provided, at the current folder
